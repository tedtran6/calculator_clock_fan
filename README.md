# calculator_clock_fan
This was one of the largest projects I've ever done in Arduino. This is compiled of 3 different MIDI devices.

It uses a TI calculator as a beat machine whenever one of tbe numbers were pressed.
It uses the minute and hour hands on a clock as sensors to convert to MIDI output as well. 
And it also uses a regular computer fan as a sensor that can calculate the RPM of the fan which then uses the calculation that is made translates to different kinds of MIDI output.

There should be a video I post here. I forgot to take a lot of photos.
